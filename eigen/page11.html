            <p><b>Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis)</b>,<br>
                An isolated population of orangutans in the Batang Toru area of South Tapanuli was reported in 1939.[5] The population was rediscovered by an expedition to the area in 1997,[6] but it was not recognized as a distinct species then.[7] Pongo tapanuliensis was identified as a distinct species, following a detailed phylogenetic study in 2017. The study analyzed the genetic samples of 37 wild orangutans from populations across Sumatra and Borneo and conducted a morphological analysis of the skeletons of 34 adult males.[2] The holotype of the species is the complete skeleton of an adult male from Batang Toru who died after being wounded by locals in November 2013.[2][8] The holotype is stored in the Zoological Museum of Bogor.[2] The skull and teeth of the Batang Toru male differ significantly from those of the other two orangutan species.[2][9] Comparisons of the genomes of all 37 orangutans using principal component analysis and population genetic models also indicated that the Batang Toru population is a separate species.[2]
                The specific name, tapanuliensis, as well as the common name, Tapanuli orangutan, refer to Tapanuli, the hilly region in North Sumatra where the species lives.[2][10]
